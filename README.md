# Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques to help businesses identify customers who are likely to discontinue services and take proactive retention measures.

---

## Project Summary

Customer churn has a direct impact on business revenue.  
In this project, we build a machine learning model that predicts churn based on customer demographics, service usage, and billing information.

The objective is to classify customers as **Churn** or **No Churn** using historical data and evaluate the model using standard performance metrics.

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Random Forest Classifier  

---

## Methodology

- Data preprocessing using label encoding and feature scaling  
- Feature engineering to improve model learning  
- Train-test split for model validation  
- Model training using Random Forest  
- Evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC-AUC  

---

## Results

The model performance is evaluated using:
- Accuracy score  
- Classification report  
- Confusion matrix  
- ROC curve and AUC score  

These metrics help assess the model’s ability to correctly identify churn-prone customers.

## Future Scope

- Training on real-world telecom datasets  
- Hyperparameter tuning  
- Comparing multiple ML models  
- Deploying the model as a web service
